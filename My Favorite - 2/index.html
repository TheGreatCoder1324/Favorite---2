		<p>My favourite hobby is reading. I enjoy reading a book when I am free. I started to do it when I was five years old. The first time I did it, I felt interested. So I kept reading. The teachers always taught me to read the difficult words. I was happy when I read a story with a happy ending. I was thrilled when I read a mystery story. I enjoy reading because I like to explore the imaginative world of my favourite author, Katerine Limbaugh and her husband who writes “ Rush Revere Series ” . There are a lot of advantages of reading. Reading can make me focused and calm. I can also learn new vocabulary items. Then I can further improve my English. Moreover, it can give me an unlimited imagination, so I can write books in the future. I can learn the different cultures and customs of other countries in the world too. I read chapter books often but when I read them I go for the whole day until its finished but thats sometimes. I read books by myself. I usually read it at home. I like to read many different books they always make me enjoyed!</p>
